# Installing
Installing Nustack is very easy if you have pip installed, just run `pip install nustack` to install, and `pip install -U nustack to upgrade`. All dependencies will automatically be installed.

If you don't have pip, or want to install a development version, clone this repository, cd into it, and run `python setup.py install`. You will have to have the setuptools package installed.

See [the tests directory](../../tests) for instructions on how to run the tests.

You must have Python 3.2+ or PyPy3 installed to run Nustack
